# Description

I worked on this website to address the overall accessibility of the website. I did this by analyzing and assesing the structure of the starter code that was provided to me and ensured that it followed a logical structure that made sense to its users. I added alt tags to all pictures and icons within the site, and I adjusted the contrast between text and background colors.
